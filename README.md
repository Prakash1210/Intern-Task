# Login and Sign Up Page

This project is a simple web application that allows users to create an account and log in using their credentials. The project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the front-end interface and validate the user input. 

- The project has two pages: a login page and a sign up page.
- The login page allows users to enter their email and password and log in to the application. If the user does not have an account, they can click on the "Create an account" link to go to the sign up page.
- The sign up page allows users to enter their name, email, password  and create an account. If the user already has an account, they can click on the "Log in" link to go back to the login page.
- The project uses HTML forms and CSS styles to create the layout and design of the pages.
